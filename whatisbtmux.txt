BattleTech MUX (Multi User eXperience) is a simulation game of unique proportions. While it concentrates mostly battles against other players you can also get experience in the game by fighting bots in the simulators.

BattleTech MUX is a game that is played against human opponents over a computer network, usually the internet. There are also computer-controlled bots to fight against.

BattleTech MUX is complex. There is no denying that. The computer removes most of the complexity of the game, and allows you to manage things more easily. However, if you want to be the best of the best players, it will require you to manage your mechs, paying attention to every detail. Small advantages in the beginning of the game can pay big dividends later. It is hard to catch up.

The learning curve for the game is, as a result, rather steep. But it is far from impossible to become a good player in just a few games. Once in a while there are players who become great in a few games. It's a matter of how good you really are at such games combined with your knack for managing the environment of the game.

BattleTech MUX is not for the light of heart, nor the weak of mind. But for those who tread in the tortured landscapes of BattleTech battlegrounds, you will no doubt enjoy yourself on some level, perhaps satisfying inner neo-lithic desires in the process.
